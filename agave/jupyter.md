### Why Use Jupyter Notebooks?

- Create readable analyses of interactive code, which is notoriously difficult to document`.`

- Facilitate collaboration as notebooks can be shared in a variety of formats with people with different levels of expertise`.`
  - Converted into `pdf` documents, slides, shareable `HTML` pages _etc_.

- Code and idea can be well illustrated with text and, if needed, rich media`.`

- Ideal for teaching and explaining complex ideas`.`
  - Breaking down concepts into small, well-documented chunks of code`.`

### Components of a notebook

- A notebook is comprised of one or more cells`.`

  - Each cell can contain Code statements (__Code__) or text (__Markdown__)`.`

    - Markdown is a syntax that facilitates formatting text`.`
    - See [here](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) for a quick overview of the syntax`.`


### Executing  a cell

  - You can run a cell (render markdown or execute code) by pressing `SHIFT+ENTER`

### Jupyter Notebook File

  - You can click/edit the temporary tile (`Untitled`) to change the file name`.`
  - The notebook files have the `ipynb` extension`.`
  - The files are stored in a format called `JSON.`
    - They are not meant to be human readable/editable. Therefore you will need to open them on Jupyter to easily edit or run them`.`
