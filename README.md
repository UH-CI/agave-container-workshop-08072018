This FREE workshop is sponsored by the University of Hawai'i Information Technology Service Cyberinfrastructure group, Texas Advanced Computing Center and Hawai'i EPSCoR.

This workshop focuses specifically on introducing the Agave platform (http://agaveapi.co), and Container Technologies  that enable advanced compute, data management and analysis on distributed resources.

Attendees will learn about the latest trends in scientific computing and how to access some of these amazing resources,including the UH High Performance computing cluster, for their own research.  In addition attendees will learn how to leverage Agave and Containers for managing their compute and data.  We will introduce other tools such as Jupyter notebooks that can help enable reproducible scientific analysis.


## Takeaways:

### By the end of this workshop attendees will be able to:
* Have a basic understanding of Singularity containers in relation to science.
* Create applications using Agave.
* Use Agave to launch computational jobs.
* Use Agave to manage data.
* Launch computation on the UH HPC.
* Launch containers on the UH HPC.


## Requirements before the Workshop:
* Participants should bring their laptops and plan to participate actively.
* Laptops will require a browser application for accessing Jupyter notebooks and Agave ToGo.
* A terminal application will be required to use SSH for connecting to the UH HPC Mac and Linux should already have one for Windows we recommend <a href="https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/download.html">MobaXterm</a>



## Registration:
Registration is limited. <u>Please Register before August 3rd.</u>
